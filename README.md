“We have done this assignment completely on our own. We have not copied
it, nor have We given our solution to anyone else. We understand that if
We are involved in plagiarism or cheating We will have to sign an
official form that We have cheated and that this form will be stored in
Our official university record. We also understand that We will receive a
grade of 0 for the involved assignment for our first offense and that We
will receive a grade of F for the course for any additional
offense.
